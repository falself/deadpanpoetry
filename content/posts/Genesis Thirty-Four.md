# Genesis Thirty-Four

Dinah was raped by a prince—  
who supposedly also harbors tendernesses  
such as 'love' and 'a curated soul'—  
while she was seen standing too still 
in a half-built town.

Pathogenically-named Shechem  
decides he’d like to defile her  
on a more regular basis,  
asks, _Daddy, may I have it?_

His father pulls a few strings,  
lands a meeting with her 
designated patriarchal representative.
Jacob simulates his own funeral  
while his sons feign hospitality  
with phony utensils.

It goes something like this:

> _Let’s all move in together._  
> _We’ll partake of your daughters,_  
> _and you’ll partake of ours._  
> _It’s all disease-free._  
> _Let’s party._

The brothers submit a formal revision.

> _Of course, we'd share your livestock and land._  
> _But first—small irreversible thing:_  
> _you must all be circumcised._

The crowd shrugs in abject misunderstanding.

Not only did Hamor and son fancy the deal,  
they somehow convinced an entire town 
of men to get simultaneous circumcisions  
with one big, long, impressive speech.

Now, I don’t claim to know  
how one properly medicates 
an adult-size snipping,  
but I’m sure these men do not either.

So they drank themselves into stupor,
and by the third night,
when their groins were sermons of regret,  
Simeon and Levi crept in  
and slew every male by the sword.

Each piled his new wives, children,  
livestock, and miscellaneous foreskins  
on the back of a camel headed home.

Jacob says something like,  
_"Thanks for making me look like a jackass."_

Everyone apparently forgets  
to ask Dinah how she’s doing.
