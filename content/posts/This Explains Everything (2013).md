# This Explains Everything (2013)

Last night, the attic filed an incident report.
A pair of yellow fingers descended
to take my two remaining arms.

They were laid upon a ceremonial slab
where they were judged and found wanting,
reassigned to the Department of Impotent Members.

This is what it looks like
to be 33 years late for everything.

The rent is due, but the walls are peeling.
The landlord says it’s only a cosmetic issue.
I told him the door opens into another decade. 

My roommate insisted just last month
he doesn't want to live with *her*.
Today he left me a note on the mirror.
It was signed in someone else’s handwriting.

This is how we lost Paul.
Rest in peace, Paul. 
Or whatever your new name is.

Writing a letter is nothing like riding a bicycle.
I stubbed my big toe attempting to emphasize.
I have completely forgotten how to convey emotion.

There is a tiny man crying out from inside
the refrigerator. He’s waving a white flag.
Perhaps he wants to be eaten.
