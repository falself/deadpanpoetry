# You May Keep the Foot

When I begged you
to lend me your bonesaw
what I meant to say was
it’s nearly time I was set
loose in my natural habitat.
I am all grown up
and thoroughly sorry—
you may keep the foot
as proof of concept 
or conversation fodder,
either way I shall suffer  
irreparable social malign
mostly because of your
human limb collection.
