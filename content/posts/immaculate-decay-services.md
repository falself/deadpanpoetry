Join us March 30, 2025, beside the quiet wreckage.

We’re rebranding. Sincerely.
There will be snacks.
We have witnesses everywhere.

We’ve taken every precaution
to uphold the undulating orthodoxy
required for our next fashionable collapse.

We apologize:
the wind carried us off
gently, but with unmistakable contempt.

Mention specific textures or aromas—
(e.g., butter-nation, new mess jars,
spatial disguises, mettle jellyfish, itty-bitties)
to receive a complimentary access violation!

Exclusions may apply to dead things.

We regret to inform the you of tomorrow
that your bad blood application
has been denied, on account of virulence.

In its place, you’ve been awarded:
one (1) commemorative shadow,
a moral debt,
and the unfortunate gait
of a man who recently lost a wager.

Please be advised:
The parking permits have expired.
The ceiling fan is drunk.
Your spine was last seen
offering itself to the nearest vacancy.
