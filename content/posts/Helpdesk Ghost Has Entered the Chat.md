# Helpdesk Ghost Has Entered the Chat

No one knocks  
on a digital coffin.

I answer tickets  
like a priest sorting teeth.  
Someone’s spreadsheet has eaten itself again.  
The printer speaks in tongues.  
Sandra from Marketing  
clicks “Reply All”  
and summons the locusts.

They type my name wrong  
in every request.  
I am “ASAP”  
I am “Halp”  
I am "???"

Sometimes they thank the air  
after I fix it.  
Not me,  
just the air.  
That ancient deity of ambient resolution.

I exist  
precisely 1.7 seconds  
before frustration  
becomes blame.

I am suspected  
of naps,  
moonlighting,  
and witchcraft  
because I live in a zip code  
that begins with a different digit.

The VPN forgets me hourly.  
Slack forgets me in real-time.  
My camera is always off.  
I tell them it’s the drivers.  
It isn't.  
I just don’t want them to see  
what a man becomes  
when he has spoken to no one  
outside of password resets  
since the Equinox.

One time,  
a manager said,  
“Thanks, man.”  
I printed the email,  
framed it,  
burned the frame,  
and buried the ashes  
in the potted fern beside my router.

There is no camaraderie in latency. 
Only the cold, recursive syntax of needing.
No warmth in the ping replies— 
just packet loss where friendship used to be.

There is only the unending plague  
of user error  
and the long,  
funeral dirge  
of the backspace key.

Still,  
every morning,  
I log in  
like a whisper with a clipboard.  
Invisible.  
Indispensable.  
Detested.  
Like plumbing.  
Like legacy code.
