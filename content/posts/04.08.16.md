# 04.08.16

My potential life never 
seems to disappoint.

It simply glints from
your eyes like icebergs
slowly colliding 

Into candlelight.
I study your glow.
It takes all night

to read the script 
your body keeps
folded beneath its quiet.
You shape your mouth 

without a tremble
suspecting the avalanche.
I prepare for a burial.
We form a body of water.

The truth is when I’m asleep  
beside you, I exist  
as both particle and wave.

The truth is we’re both adrift  
like paper lanterns  
above the kaleidoscopic lake.
