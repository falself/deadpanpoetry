# Who Is This!?

**Deadpan Poetry Is:**
- A moth in a suit, requesting clarification.  
- Assuming all furniture has an inner life.  
- A gentle haunting conducted under fluorescent light.  
- A form of controlled failure dressed in evening wear.  
- A small and mostly manageable outbreak of sincerity.

**Deadpan Poetry Is Not:**
- Approved for devotional use.  
- Responsible for what it implies.  
- An instruction manual, though some have tried.

## About

**Deadpan Poetry** is an ongoing experiment in the art of the absurd, the mundane, and the unexpectedly profound. Here, language is both a tool and a toy, wielded with a straight face and a crooked smile.​ It will not make sense, but it will file correctly.

All works, unless otherwise noted, are the creations of **Zach Foss**—a name as real as a receipt for grief, or as fictitious as your parking space. The poems are his, but you may claim them in the presence of your hypothetical girlfriend, should you need to secure temporary affection during a power outage or file a complaint with animal control.

Images are used by permission, license, or conjured with the assistance of a largely cooperative neural apparition, bound by spell and silicon. Opinions expressed herein are solely those of the author and do not reflect the views of any known institutions, defunct governments, corporate weather systems, or sentient elevator panels.

For those seeking meaning, direction, or a coherent narrative—good luck with that.
