Zachary Aaron is a seditious honky. He protruded in the horrible summer of 1980. Curiously, everyone in the delivery room simultaneously exploded. He mismanages a literary blog, deadpanpoetry.org. l've seen worse. He dwells in a soporific canard in the mountains of Tennessee, and is objectively better than everyone else in the trailer park. To summarize: marginal poetry, ribbit translator, recovering misanthrope, large breasts, dreadfully sorry.
