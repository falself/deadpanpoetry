#The Ledger of Minor Affections

You’ve reached The Ledger of Minor Affections, an unofficial registry of small, unclassified gratitudes.

If you’ve read something here that stirred, unsettled, or slightly reorganized you—
or if you, too, have been cited for tone violations—
you may, at your discretion, record a minor affection in the form of a financial transfer.

This is not an extortion.
Transmissions will proceed as designated, inexorably.

These offerings will not grant you exclusive access, celestial reward, or digital stickers.
They will, however, be noted quietly and without ceremony in a drawer that does not lock properly.

Funds are used exclusively for:
	•	Archival maintenance
	•	Neural hydration
	•	Emergency metaphors
	•	Mild snacks during philosophical impasses
	•	Stamps

All entries are anonymous unless otherwise compelled by dream logic or outdated regulation.
No one is watching. The drawer thanks you in advance, regardless.

*This ledger is not tax-deductible, nor spiritually binding. Use only in cases of persistent unease or excess gratitude.*
